## Get started
You can set up the environment with all dependencies like so:
```
conda create --name NPP-Net python=3.8.5
conda activate NPP-Net
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## High-Level structure
* data: input examples for completion, remapping, and segmentation.
* externel_lib: externel library to support our code.
* loadersï¼šdataloader
* models:  helper functions for model
* options: arguments for training.
* NPP_proposal: implementation for top-K periodicity proposal.
* NPP_completion: implementation for completion task. 
* NPP_segmentation: implementation for segmentation task. 
* NPP_remapping: implementation for remapping task. 

## How to Run


1. Please download the file (https://github.com/42x00/p3i)  download the pre-trained AlexNet weight in the "Pre-trained Models" section. 

2. Put the downloaded file (alexnet-owt-4df8aa71.pth) in the root of this directory. 


### NPP Completion

Run all examples in the "data/completion/input" using the following command.

```
bash run_completion.sh
```

This script first searches the periodicity of the image, saved in "data/completion/detected". 
Then it performs image completion, generating the outputs in "results/completion_top3".




### NPP Segmentation

Run all examples in the "data/segmentation/input" using the following command.

```
bash run_segmentation.sh
```

This script first searches the periodicity of the image, saved in "data/segmentation/detected". 
Then it performs image segmentation, generating the outputs in "results/segmentation_top3". 




### NPP Remapping

Run all examples in the "data/remapping/input" using the following command.

```
bash run_remapping.sh
```

This script first searches the periodicity of the image, saved in "data/remapping/detected". 
Then it performs image remapping, generating the outputs in "results/remapping_top3". 


## Disclaimer

The result produced by this code might be slightly different when running on a different GPU.
